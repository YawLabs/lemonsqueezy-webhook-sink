# --- CHANGELOG promotion (ported from ctxlint) ---------------------------
# These scripts never promoted the [Unreleased] heading, so documented work
# accumulated there and shipped versions went out undocumented -- the cause of
# seven backfilled entries across this fleet on 2026-08-23. The promotion then
# skipped any release with nothing under [Unreleased], and step 6 took the
# GitHub release notes from commit subjects regardless, so ten versions shipped
# on 2026-09-13 with no changelog entry and subject-list release notes.
#
# Every release now gets a `## [<version>]` entry, and step 6 sources the
# release notes from it:
#   * [Unreleased] has content -> it becomes the version section, and a fresh,
#     empty [Unreleased] heading is left above it for the next change.
#   * [Unreleased] is empty or absent -> a version section is generated from
#     the commit subjects since the previous tag. Raw subjects are less than a
#     hand-written entry, but a version with no entry at all reads as a mistake.
#   * The Keep-a-Changelog link references at the bottom, when the file has
#     them, are moved along: [Unreleased] compares from the new tag, and the
#     version gets its own compare link.

# SKIP_LINT=1 escape hatch -- wraps `npm`/`pnpm` so lint-related runs are
# no-ops.
#
# THIS SHOULD NOW BE UNNECESSARY, and reaching for it is a signal something
# regressed. `npm run lint` routes through scripts/lint.mjs, which picks a
# biome binary that works on the host -- on Windows ARM64 it provisions the x64
# build of the version the LOCKFILE installs and runs it under emulation rather
# than trusting whichever arm64 build npm resolved. Verified: `npm run lint`
# exits 0 on that host.
#
# The earlier text here blamed "the MINGW64-ARM64 npm-run-script wrapper" and
# justified skipping with "CI catches lint regressions anyway". Both were wrong.
# `npm run` is fine on that host; the crash comes from the arm64 biome
# executable of the affected version itself, reproducible by invoking that
# binary directly with no npm in the picture. Measured here: arm64 2.5.4 exits
# 139 on this repo's src/, while 2.4.16, 2.5.13 and the 2.5.1 the lockfile
# installs all run correctly -- so the crash is per-build, and the native path
# is healthy only by accident of which build npm resolved. And this repo has no
# CI: there is no .github directory, so nothing downstream re-checks formatting
# -- skipping the lint step means the release is published unlinted, full stop.
#
# So: only set SKIP_LINT=1 if scripts/lint.mjs cannot produce a result at all,
# and treat that as a bug to fix rather than a step to routinely skip. Without
# it, step 1 fails the release on ANY non-zero lint exit, a crash included.
